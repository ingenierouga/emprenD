# EmprenD

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Routing

This Angular Demo Application consists of 3 main pages:

- Inicio (root): This page is mostly to practice and show responsive design using bootstrap along with Angular, you can find the details of each of the sections on this page further down in this document
- Login (/login): This page has a simple form with two fields to practice and show Angular validation in the input fields, and register the current logged user for the blog page (a template driven validation is used here).
- Blog (/blog): Simple form to save Ideas.

## Inicio (start)

This page is using multiple Angular components along with bootstrap to simulate a bussines presentacion page, the sections on the page are:

- Header (no login required): this header is meant to be used in this page only since it includes the specific navigation items for this page, it implements a soft scrolling functionallity that will take you to the section that corresponds to the link clicked.
  It will also collapse on small screen sizes into a button, click on the button and you will see the menu.
- Banner: Shows a section with a picture as the whole background, it uses a custom component to separate the main tittle with the sub tittle since the same separator will be required on other sections.
- Nosotros: section divided into two other sections, implements a button that matches the style of the page and also uses the separator component.
  Here the Container element used for the section is container-fluid so it can take the full width and expand the image on the second part of the section all the way to the edge of the section.
- Servicios: Shows multiple items that can be used to shows multiple other items, could be improved by adding some sections with more info for each service when you click on them, for now they only change the background color with a smooth transition when you hover over them.
  Uses the separator component and the icons are taken from the bootstrap library, also the hover is applied with SCSS, directly into the component, no ts/js logic used for this effect.
  -Caracterist√≠cas: Another presentation section, as with the "Nosotros" section this section is divided in two but the section on the left is a bit bigger, used a ratio of 7 to 5 (bootstrap colums) and the container wrapping this section is not fluid so the image (and the text secion) will not go all the way to the edge of the section giving it a "framed" look.
- Nuestro Equipo de Trabajo (Equipo): here something a bit more complicated was implemented, a new component was created to hold each of the team member, on the ts file for the section an array "Member" object is made (the Member model is defined on another file inside the section component folder), the Member has a field for his name, his picture path, a description of the member and one field for each the social networks (twitter,facebook,linkedn, email, googlePlus, Youtube, Pinterest and Tumblr, the constructor will take the values on that order).
  It has not been implemented but the idea is to use those fields to fill the links for each of the icons and if the link was not provided show in the UI that the social network link was not provided, by not changing the pointes as if the icon was clickable and probably show a tooltip with a message "Social Network not available".
  The "picturePath", "tittle, and "description" values do populate the first section of the member holder, and a "Member Holder" box will be created for each of the "Member" objects in the array and automatically sorted, 2 per row on small screens and 3 on larger screens.
- Contacto: this section is also divided in two, one for the contact form and one for the contact info (a reactive driven validation is used here).
  The contact form will validate that the fields are present and some extra validations:
  name - required.
  emai - required and email format.
  telefono - required and only numbers and min 8 max 10 numbers.
  fecha - a Date is required in order to be able to send the contact info form.
  mensaje - required and not longer than 250 characters.
  button - the button will not be enabled, the hover wont work and the color will fade when the form is not valid, once all the fields are valid the button will light up and you'll be able to click it

The second section here has some demo basic information and it implements a maps widget, the widget will dissapear on small screens since it wont on the design for small screens.

- Footer: the footer has 3 sections, one for the EmprenD logo and name, a separator component, another section for sub-sections which right now have the icons for the allowed demo payment options and another for the contact demo info, and a third section below to show the social network links for the bussines.

## Inicio

This page has a simple login form, the idea is to look for the user in DB and if it's found check the provided password matches, but right now it is not connected to a DB.
After validating the user the username will be saved on a service to then tell the "Blog" page the current loged used so it can be used as the creator for a registered idea.
redirection once logged in is also missing.

## Blog

This is a simple form which saves an idea (validated - required, max 500 characters), once the idea is valid the current logged user and the current date will be added to the idea and then showen in the blog-log component below, if no user had logged in "Anonimo" will be used as "created by".
The button will follow the behavior as the button on the "Contacto" form and wont be enabled unless the idea is valid.
Also the header used here is different, this one does not have the navigation links and will check the service for the current logged used and show his username.
Here Reactive Driven Validation was used.

## Services

The project implements a couple of services for different uses.

- Modal Service: Service used to call openNotificationModal(tittle, message), the tittle will be added as the tittle to the modal and the message will be showed as the body of the modal, this modal can only be close, the is no implementation of a modal for confirmation.
- Logged Service: Service used to manage the connection to DB to sign up or register users through the login page.
- Ideas Service: Service that handles the connections to the APIs that connect to the DB to save the Ideas information.
- Contacto Service: Service that handles the connections to the APIs that connect to the DB to save the contact information.

## Database

The database is managed with firebase, currently it is on test mode so any call will be saved, once the authentication module is finished it will be changed so only logged in users will be able to see and use the blog page, the contact information will remain open since that is meant to be used by any user.

## Running unit tests

Unit Tests pending.
